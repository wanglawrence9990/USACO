# Resources

> well i wanna ask you i covered up almost all the basics topics now i wanna move to advanced level like graph theory or some could u please share some study materials with me

Please see "README.md" and "Olympiads.md" in "Contests" as well.

## Why Use C++?

There are many reasons to use C++11 over Java, such as
  * better speed (especially important in CodeForces & CSAcademy)
  * typically shorter / simpler
  * miscellaneous shortcuts such as #define, typedef, auto
  * good STL
