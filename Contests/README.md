# Contests

## Contest Sites

See [clist.by](http://clist.by/) for an extensive list. Most of the contests which I do are a subset of those shown in "Programming Contests.png". A link to my google calendar is available [here.](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Y2s5ZjdmZDBkNjdmOGFxZ2oxbDVrMHJ1OGtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) See the other page for olympiads such as USACO.

Make sure to [upsolve](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/upsolve) after the contest ends! I particularly enjoy problems from AtCoder and CSAcademy. :)
